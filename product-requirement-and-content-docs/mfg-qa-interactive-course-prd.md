Second, it will reduce training time and costs by providing a scalable, repeatable educational resource that can be accessed by new hires and existing employees for refresher training.

The course will also serve as a compliance documentation tool, demonstrating Kind Oasis's commitment to employee education and regulatory adherence to potential auditors and regulatory bodies. By implementing this comprehensive training program, Kind Oasis will strengthen its position as a leader in quality manufacturing within the hemp-derived wellness products industry.

### Target Audience

The primary target audience consists of Kind Oasis manufacturing team members at all levels, from entry-level production workers to experienced quality assurance professionals and supervisors. The course is designed to accommodate varying levels of technical expertise and prior knowledge of cannabis manufacturing processes.

Secondary audiences include new hires who require comprehensive onboarding in quality assurance practices, existing employees seeking refresher training or updates on regulatory changes, and supervisory staff who need to understand quality systems for effective team management. The course content is structured to be accessible to individuals with diverse educational backgrounds while maintaining the technical depth required for professional cannabis manufacturing.

The interactive design elements and multiple learning modalities ensure that the content is engaging for different learning preferences, including visual learners who benefit from infographics and diagrams, auditory learners who prefer narrated content, and kinesthetic learners who engage with interactive simulations and hands-on exercises.

### Success Metrics

Success will be measured through multiple quantitative and qualitative metrics that demonstrate both learning effectiveness and business impact. Primary metrics include course completion rates, with a target of 95% completion within the first month of implementation, and assessment scores, with a target average of 85% or higher across all knowledge checkpoints.

Engagement metrics will track time spent in each module, interaction rates with various course elements, and user feedback scores through integrated Net Promoter Score (NPS) surveys. The platform will monitor progress tracking accuracy, bookmark usage, and return visit patterns to understand user behavior and identify areas for improvement.

Business impact metrics will include reduction in quality-related incidents, improved audit performance scores, decreased training time for new hires, and enhanced regulatory compliance documentation. Long-term success indicators include employee retention rates among trained staff, customer satisfaction scores related to product quality, and cost savings from reduced waste and rework.
